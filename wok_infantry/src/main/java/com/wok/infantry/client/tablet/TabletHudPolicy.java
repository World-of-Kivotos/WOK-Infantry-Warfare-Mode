/**
 * Which HUD layers stand aside for the tablet (DESIGN 3.5 third round, review F7; IMPL_PLAN D14).
 * Pure rules, no Minecraft state.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A tablet screen open, the animation opening or shown: everything but the white list is
 *   hidden, on every path and setting (the D2 device does not cover the screen, so the hotbar and
 *   ammo count would peek out around it).</li>
 *   <li>Closing on scheme A: the crosshair returns at p 0.40, the rest at p 0.17 (K0, the moment
 *   the tablet leaves the picture).</li>
 *   <li>Closing on scheme B or the quick setting: everything returns on the first frame (the
 *   falling device is drawn above the HUD).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>White list: vanilla chat, titles and subtitles (anim-spec {@code a.hud.keep}) and this
 * module's own {@code tablet_motion} layer. Beyond the plan (IMPL_PLAN D14) the vanilla full-screen
 * world tints stay as well (vignette, spyglass, pumpkin / powder snow, frostbite, portal, sleep
 * fade): they are part of the world behind the device, not HUD that peeks out beside it.
